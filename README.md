Diffusion MRI are often subjected to noise when higher b-values (the higher the b-value, the higher the tissues contrast) 
are used to acquire the images. This repo includes an attempt to denoise a Diffusion MRI (single shell, b = 1000, no.of q vectors = 64)
that is subjected to a spatial stationary Rician Noise. 

The work is based on the following papers.

Geng Chen, Yafeng Wu, Dinggang Shen, Pew-Thian Yap, Noise reduction in diffusion MRI using non-local self- similar information in joint x−q space, Medical Image Analysis,Volume 53, 2019, Pages 79-94, ISSN 1361-8415

The work was carried out to fulfill an assignment of BM4301 - Medical Image Processing. The slides highlighting the paper review and the final demontration can be found below.
